            Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, Bengali pronunciation: [kazi nozrul islam] (About this
            soundlisten);
            May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was mainly a Bengali language poet, writer, musician, and Indian
            revolutionary, later, the
            national poet of Bangladesh. Popularly known as Nazrul, he produced a large body of poetry and music
            with themes that
            included religious devotion and rebellion against oppression. Nazrul's activism for political and social
            justice
            earned him the title of "Rebel Poet" (Bengali: বিদ্রোহী কবি; Bidrohi Kobi). His compositions form the
            avant-garde
            genre of Nazrul Geeti (Music of Nazrul).
            Born in a Bengali Muslim Kazi family, Nazrul Islam received religious education and as a young man
            worked as a muezzin
            at a local mosque. He learned about poetry, drama, and literature while working with the rural
            theatrical group Letor
            Dal. He joined the British Indian Army in 1917. After serving in the British Indian Army in the Middle
            East
            (Mesopotamian campaign) during World War I,Nazrul established himself as a journalist in Calcutta. He
            criticised the
            British Raj and called for revolution through his poetic works, such as "Bidrohi" ("বিদ্রোহী", 'The
            Rebel') and "Bhangar
            Gaan" ("ভাঙার গান", 'The Song of Destruction'),as well as in his publication Dhumketu ('The
            Comet'). His
            nationalist activism in Indian independence movement led to his frequent imprisonment by the colonial
            British
            authorities. While in prison, Nazrul wrote the "Rajbandir Jabanbandi" ("রাজবন্দীর জবানবন্দী",
            'Deposition of a Political
            Prisoner'). His writings greatly inspired Bengalis of East Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation
            War.
